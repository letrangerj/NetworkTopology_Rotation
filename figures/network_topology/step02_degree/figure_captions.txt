Caption:
Distribution of functional-group producer out-degrees (number of pyoverdines produced per functional group).
Across 177 functional groups and 93 validated pyoverdines the mean producer out-degree is 0.99 (median = 1, max = 3),
with 43 functional groups lacking validated production. Biologically, this distribution indicates that most
functional strategies are specialists or non-producers under conservative validation, while a minority produce
multiple pyoverdines and function as production hubs that may supply the communal siderophore pool.

figures/network_topology/degree_dist_fg_consumer.pdf
Caption:
Distribution of functional-group consumer in-degrees (number of pyoverdines each functional group can utilize).
Functional groups have mean consumer in-degree 12.64 (median = 10, max = 39) and only 4 groups lack validated
utilization capacity. The skew toward higher consumer degrees suggests many groups possess broad receptor repertoires,
implying widespread potential for cross-feeding and receptor-based exploitation within ecological communities.

Caption:
Distribution of strain-level producer out-degrees (number of pyoverdines produced per strain).
At the strain level (1,809 strains × 93 pyovs) the mean producer out-degree is 1.08 (median = 1, max = 3),
and 225 strains have no validated production. This pattern highlights within-group heterogeneity and the presence
of a substantial non-producer fraction under conservative criteria—important for interpreting producer–defector
dynamics and the distribution of biosynthetic capacity across genomes.

Caption:
Distribution of strain-level consumer in-degrees (number of pyoverdines each strain can utilize).
Strain consumer in-degrees show mean 7.85 (median = 3, max = 39) with 4 strains lacking validated receptors.
The long right tail reveals candidate generalist strains with broad receptor complements that could access many
pyoverdines and thereby hold competitive advantage for iron acquisition in mixed communities.

Caption:
Complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDFs) for FG-level degrees (producer and consumer), plotted
on log–log axes for heavy-tail inspection. The FG producer distribution is compact (mean ≈ 1.0, max = 3) while the
consumer distribution is more heavy-tailed (mean ≈ 12.6, max = 39), indicating a network architecture where
production is constrained and relatively specialist, whereas utilization is broadly shared, creating uptake hubs.
These asymmetries inform hypotheses about the flow of public siderophores and potential vulnerability to receptor-mediated exploitation.

Caption:
CCDFs for strain-level degrees (producer and consumer) on log–log axes. Although producer degrees remain concentrated
(mean ≈ 1.08, max = 3), pyoverdine- and strain-level measures of production and utilization display strong skew (pyov
production in-degree mean ≈ 20.95, max = 768; pyov utilization out-degree mean ≈ 152.67, max = 869), revealing that
particular pyoverdines and certain strains act as dominant hubs for production and uptake. Such dominant nodes have
disproportionate ecological impact and are important targets for sensitivity and robustness analyses.
