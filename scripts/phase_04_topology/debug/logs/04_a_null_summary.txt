Phase 04 - Step 04a: Independent Null Model NODF Analysis Summary (FG Only)
Timestamp: 2025-10-09 19:24:03 CST
Method: Independent vegan::oecosimu(curveball) + bipartite::nested
Runtime: 32.3 seconds (3.1 nulls/sec)
Independence: Individual generation with unique seeds
Algorithm: nsimul=2 per null, take first value (avoids nsimul=1 bug)

Functional Group (FG) Level:
  Observed NODF: 20.369
  Valid nulls: 100 out of 100 (100.0% success rate)
  Null mean ± SD: 20.441 ± 0.089
  Null median: 20.408
  Null range: 20.334 - 20.691

Statistical Tests:
  P-value (two-tailed): 0.3564
  Z-score: -0.812
  Standardized Effect Size (SES): -0.812
  Significance: Not significant

Interpretation:
  SES > 2: Strong positive deviation (more nested than expected)
  SES < -2: Strong negative deviation (less nested than expected)
  |SES| < 2: Within expected range given degree constraints

Independence Validation:
  ✅ Independence check: PASSED (stable means, diff=0.036)

Note: Compact mode - only text summary saved (no RDS/PDF outputs)
Re-run with modifications if you need raw values or visualizations.
