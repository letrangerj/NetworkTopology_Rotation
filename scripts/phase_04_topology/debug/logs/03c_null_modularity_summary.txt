Phase 04 - Step 03c: Layer-Specific Null Model Modularity Test Summary
Timestamp: 2025-10-14 09:14:08 CST
Master seed: 2025
Nulls per layer: 100

Method:
  Null generation: vegan::swap.web(method = 'quasiswap')
  Modularity: bipartite::computeModules (Beckett method - same as main function)
  Statistical testing: two-tailed empirical with +1 correction
  Stability assessment: CV and ARI metrics for both observed and null distributions
  SES: (observed - null_mean) / null_sd

Production Layer:
  Status: failed
  Reason: insufficient_nulls

Utilization Layer:
  Status: failed
  Reason: insufficient_nulls

Interpretation Guidelines:
  SES > 2: Strong positive deviation (more modular than expected)
  SES < -2: Strong negative deviation (less modular than expected)
  |SES| < 2: Within expected range given degree constraints
  p_twotailed < 0.05: Statistically significant deviation
  Null CV > 0.10: High variability in null modularity estimates
  Null mean ARI < 0.60: Low consistency in null partitions

Notes:
  - Null models preserve layer-specific degree sequences using bipartite swaps
  - Quasi-swap method ensures degree preservation for bipartite networks
  - Algorithm parameters EXACTLY match main function for valid comparison
  - Stability assessed on samples of null matrices using replicates
  - Two-tailed testing more appropriate for comprehensive biological analysis
  - Results are for FG-level networks only
