Phase 04 - Step 03c: Null-model modularity test (FG-level)
Timestamp: 2025-10-09 18:48:37 CST
Method: vegan::oecosimu(curveball) + igraph Louvain
Parameters: N_NULLS=200, independent seeds, nsimul= workaround

Network Summary:
  Incidence matrix: 177 x 93 (2244 edges, 13.6% fill)

Modularity Results:
  Observed modularity:     0.4125
  Null mean ± SD:         0.4310 ± 0.0110
  Null range:            0.3876 - 0.4419
  P-value (two-tailed):   0.1095
  SES (Standardized Effect Size): -1.68
  Significance:           Not significant
  Effect interpretation:  Within expected range given degree constraints

Quality Metrics:
  Valid nulls:            200/200 (100.0%)
  Independence method:    Unique seeds per null

Interpretation Guide:
  • SES > 2: Network is more modular than degree constraints predict
  • |SES| < 2: Modularity within expected range of null models
  • p < 0.05: Statistically significant deviation from null expectation

Next steps:
  • Observed modularity not significant → Focus on other topological metrics

Note: This script intentionally writes a single text summary file only (no CSV or RDS).
The full null distribution is not saved by design; re-run with modifications if you need the raw vector.
