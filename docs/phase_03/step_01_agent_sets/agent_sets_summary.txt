Step 1 — Agent sets: provenance and produced files

This document summarizes the outputs produced by Phase 3 Step 1 (`scripts/phase_03_network/01_derive_agent_sets.R`). All files listed under "Files created" were generated by that script and are saved under `data/interim/`. Session and provenance information for the run are saved under `docs/phase_03/step_01_agent_sets/session_info.txt`.

## Phase 3 Step 1: Agent Sets Summary



### Functional Groups

- Total functional groups: 177

- Average strain count per group: 10.22

- Groups with production: 134 (75.7%)

- Groups with utilization: 173 (97.7%)



### Strains

- Total conservative strains: 1809

- Strains with production: 1584 (87.6%)

- Strains with utilization: 1805 (99.8%)



### Validation

- Consistency issues found: 0

- Non-circular validation: Performed on 10 random groups



### Dataset Statistics

- Unique pyoverdines in dataset: 93

- Unique production groups: 93

- Conservative production groups (validated pairs): 26



Files created (Step 1 outputs):

- `data/interim/nodes_functional_groups_conservative.rds` / `.csv`  — functional-group node table (list-columns for `validated_production_set` and `usable_pyoverdine_set`)

- `data/interim/nodes_strains_conservative.rds` / `.csv` — strain node table (per-strain validated sets and counts)

- `data/interim/functional_group_validation_results.rds` — validation diagnostics (empty if no issues)

Notes:
- These artifacts are the canonical agent sets used to build adjacencies in Step 3.
- The "Unique pyoverdines" count reflects synthetase group identifiers present in validated mappings (expanded list), not necessarily the collapsed 26 lock–key node representation. See Step 2 documents for the pyoverdine mapping decisions.
