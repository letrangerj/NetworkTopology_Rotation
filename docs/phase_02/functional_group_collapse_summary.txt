Phase 2 - Step 3: Functional Group Collapse Summary (Conservative)
Run timestamp: 2025-10-02 18:46:21.476708

Input Data:
  - Total strains analyzed: 1809
  - Total strains in dataset: 2808

Conservative Network Criteria:
  - Strains with validated production OR usable pyoverdines:
  - Validated producers included: 1584
  - Strains with usable pyoverdines included: 1805

Collapse Results:
  - Total functional groups created: 177
  - Total strains collapsed: 1809
  - Average collapse ratio: 10.22 strains per group
  - Maximum group size: 700
  - Minimum group size: 1

Functional Group Composition:
  - Groups with validated production: 134
  - Groups without production (pure consumers): 43
  - Groups with usable pyoverdines: 173
  - Groups without usable pyoverdines: 4

Next Steps:
  - Run 04_strategy_classification.R to classify functional groups by strategy
  - Validate group assignments and metadata consistency
