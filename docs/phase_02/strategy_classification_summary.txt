Phase 2 - Step 4: Strategy Classification Summary (Conservative)
Run timestamp: 2025-10-02 20:38:18.01498

Classification Rules Applied:
  1. Multi-producer: >1 validated production group
  2. Single-receptor producer: 1 production group, 1 usable pyoverdine
  3. Multi-receptor producer: 1 production group, >1 usable pyoverdine
  4. Nonproducer: 0 production groups, >0 usable pyoverdines
  5. Producer-only: >0 production groups, 0 usable pyoverdines
  6. Unconnected: 0 production groups, 0 usable pyoverdines

Overall Statistics:
  - Total functional groups classified: 177
  - Total strains represented: 1809
  - Average group size: 10.22

Strategy Distribution (Groups):
  - Multi-producer           :  33 groups ( 18.6%)
  - Multi-receptor producer  :  95 groups ( 53.7%)
  - Nonproducer              :  43 groups ( 24.3%)
  - Producer-only (no utilization):   4 groups (  2.3%)
  - Single-receptor producer :   2 groups (  1.1%)

Strategy Distribution (Strains):
  - Multi-producer           :  347 strains ( 19.2%)
  - Multi-receptor producer  : 1221 strains ( 67.5%)
  - Nonproducer              :  225 strains ( 12.4%)
  - Producer-only (no utilization):    4 strains (  0.2%)
  - Single-receptor producer :   12 strains (  0.7%)

Network-Ready Categories:
  - Producer groups (all types): 130
  - Nonproducer groups: 43
  - Other/Unconnected groups: 4

Next Steps:
  - Proceed to Phase 3: Network Construction
  - Use functional_groups_classified_conservative.rds for bipartite network building
  - Validate network topology against biological expectations
