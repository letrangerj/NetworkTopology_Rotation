# Phase 1 Summary: Data Exploration and Validation

## Overview
Phase 1 of the Siderophore Network Analysis Project focused on exploring, validating, and converting the raw MATLAB `.mat` files into R-friendly formats for downstream analysis. This phase established the foundation for the project by ensuring data integrity, mapping identifiers, and creating fast-loading RDS files. The work aligns with the methodological framework from Gu et al. (2025) Science Advances, preparing for network construction and topology analysis.

## Goals Accomplished
- **Data Loading and Inspection**: Successfully loaded all core `.mat` files (`syn.mat`, `rec.mat`, `pairing_result.mat`, `Syn_PWA_inGroup.mat`, `Rec_MSA_inGroup.mat`) and inspected their structures.
- **Format Conversion**: Converted MATLAB data to HDF5 intermediates and then to RDS files for efficient R analysis.
- **Validation**: Verified data dimensions, string decoding, and correspondence between files (e.g., groups in syn.mat match Syn_PWA_inGroup.mat).
- **Documentation**: Created detailed reports on export methods and data inspection results.

## Scripts and Tools Used
The scripts in `scripts/phase_01_explore_validate/` implemented the conversion and validation pipeline:

### MATLAB Scripts
- **`inspect_export_mat.m`**: MATLAB script for loading `.mat` files, inspecting structures, and exporting to HDF5 format. Handles complex cell arrays by converting strings to uint8 and saving numeric data directly.
- **`save_syn.m`** and **`save_rec.m`**: MATLAB helpers for initial processing of synthetase and receptor data (if needed for debugging).

### R Scripts
- **`save_syn.R`**: Reads `syn.h5`, converts uint8 string matrices to R character vectors, decodes JSON fields (e.g., `wholeCDS`, `biosynCDS`), and saves as `syn.rds`.
- **`save_rec.R`**: Similar to `save_syn.R`, processes `rec.h5` and saves `rec.rds`.
- **`save_mats.R`**: Handles clustering files (`Syn_PWA_inGroup.h5`, `Rec_MSA_inGroup.h5`) and pairing results (`pairing_result_v7.mat`), converting them to RDS.
- **`inspect_rds.R`**: Validation script that loads all RDS files, prints `str()` summaries, and checks key fields with `head()` to confirm successful conversion.

All scripts include error handling, use project-standard paths, and are designed for reproducibility.

## Key Results
From the RDS inspection (run via `Rscript scripts/phase_01_explore_validate/inspect_rds.R`):

- **`syn.rds`**: 21,240 synthetase entries with fields like `strainName`, `regionName`, `group` (many set to 0 for non-pyoverdine BGCs), and complex lists for CDS data.
- **`rec.rds`**: 42,190 receptor entries with sequence data (`seqs`, `domseq`), group assignments, and metadata like `recname` and `foldername`.
- **`syn_cluster.rds`**: 2,687 x 2,687 distance matrix (`distm`) for synthetase clustering, with corresponding `dataname` identifiers.
- **`rec_cluster.rds`**: 42,190 x 42,190 distance matrix for receptor clustering.
- **`pairing_result.rds`**: 26 x 2 matrix of lists representing the 26 verified pyoverdine-receptor pairs from Gu et al. (2025).

All conversions succeeded without errors, with strings properly decoded from HDF5 uint8 matrices and numeric data preserved.

## Data Quality Insights
- **Dimensions Match**: Receptor counts (42,190) align between `rec.rds` and `rec_cluster.rds`; synthetase counts (2,687 for clustering vs. 21,240 total) reflect filtered pyoverdine-relevant BGCs.
- **Group Validation**: Groups in `syn.rds` and `rec.rds` correspond to clustering in the respective cluster files, with 0 indicating non-pyoverdine.
- **Pairing Confirmation**: The 26 pairs in `pairing_result.rds` are ready for network construction.
- **No Missing Data**: All expected fields are present and populated.

## Summary Reports Created
- **`docs/data_export_method.md`**: Documents the HDF5 â†’ RDS workflow, including script details, conversion logic, and usage instructions.
- **`docs/rds_inspection_summary.txt`**: Contains the full output from `inspect_rds.R`, including `str()` summaries and `head()` checks for validation.

These reports ensure reproducibility and serve as references for future phases.

## Challenges and Resolutions
- **String Conversion**: HDF5 stores strings as uint8 matrices; resolved with custom R functions (`uint8_matrix_to_vector`) that decode to character vectors.
- **Complex Cell Arrays**: Nested lists (e.g., CDS data) were handled by JSON encoding in MATLAB and parsing in R.
- **File Formats**: Mixed MATLAB v7 and HDF5 inputs required flexible R loaders (`R.matlab::readMat()` for MAT files, `rhdf5::h5read()` for HDF5).

## Next Steps
Phase 1 is complete, providing validated RDS files for Phase 2: Functional Group Classification. The data is now ready for strain-level collapse into functional groups based on identical production/utilization profiles.

## Files and Locations
- **Scripts**: `scripts/phase_01_explore_validate/`
- **RDS Outputs**: `data/interim/rds/`
- **Reports**: `docs/phase_01/data_export_method.md`, `docs/phase_01/rds_inspection_summary.txt`
- **Raw Data**: `data/raw/Burkholderiaceae/` (unchanged)
- **Intermediates**: `data/interim/` (HDF5 files if present)

This phase successfully bridged MATLAB preprocessing with R analysis, ensuring data integrity and efficiency for the network topology project.
